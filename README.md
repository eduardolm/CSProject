# CSProject
## Simple payroll program written in C#
This program reads from a .txt file, extracts information from this file and uses this data to calculate payment values according to staff status (Manager, Admin).
The program asks for the year, month and hours worked for each staff member read from the text file.
The payment calculated for each staff member is written to .txt files named after each staff. These files hold payment information based on the entered data.
